# Space-War
Space-War is a two-player spaceship battle game set in a confined space. Players control spaceships, one in yellow and the other in red, and engage in a fast-paced battle. The objective is to shoot bullets at each other while avoiding collisions with a central border that separates the playing area. Each player can fire a limited number of bullets, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. The first player to successfully hit their opponent with a bullet wins the game. It's an exciting and competitive arcade-style game that tests players' agility and aiming skills.
